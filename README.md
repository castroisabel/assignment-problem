# assignment-problem
Given a set of resources and a set of tasks to be performed, the assignment problem consists of deciding which resources will be allocated to which tasks at the lowest possible cost. 

For this problem we use two methods:

1. The **simplex method** is an algorithm that uses linear algebra-based tooling to interactively determine an optimal solution to a linear programming problem (PPL).

3. The **greedy algorithm** is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem.
